# Welcome to RSB Summer student Bioinfo bash course  
  
This repo does contain sample datasets and python notebooks and example data for our course.

Parts of the notebook were originally authored by the late Sylvain Foret and Kevin Murray (kdmurray91). 

Author contributions are from Jana Sperschneider, Benjamin Schwessinger, Megan McDonald and Kevin Murray.

The material comes from a Kioloa field trip sequencing a tick and a cockroach. 

This material is inspired by carpentry (data carpentry and sofware carpentry).
